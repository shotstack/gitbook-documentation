# What is Shotstack?

Shotstack uses a REST based API hosted in the cloud that uses JSON data describing the arrangement of a video edit.

The JSON data can be used to arrange, trim and animate assets including images, video, titles and audio. It also includes a number of built in effects, transitions, filters and title styles to rapidly edit a professional looking video.

The cloud based API provides the infrastructure to allow thousands of videos to be rendered concurrently in a matter of minutes allowing for mass personalisation and customisation of content.

# Request API Keys

## Sign up to receive your API Key

[Sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUSMOlpd_cy5TktKpki3aYEbfbpMcJpYMq0xnDjUWfSPoyNw/viewform) to the Shotstack service to receive an API key, we'll email you keys for both a staging sandbox and a live production environment.

Keys are a random 40 character string that look something like:

```text

```

Staging sandbox and production URL's are:

| Sandbox URL | Production URL |
| :--- | :--- |
| [https://api.shotstack.io/stage](https://api.shotstack.io/stage) | [https://api.shotstack.io/v1](https://api.shotstack.io/v1) |

{% hint style="success" %}
 You can use your sandbox account as much as you like, rate limits apply and videos are watermarked.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Using your production key will use up your credits and may result in being charged.
{% endhint %}

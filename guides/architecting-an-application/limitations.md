# Limitations

### Render Time

Rendering video is a CPU and memory intensive process and takes time to complete – expect 1 to 4 seconds rendering time per second of video.

It will be slower at higher resolutions \(i.e. 1080p HD vs SD\) and with effects, filters and transitions applied. Keep this in mind when doing status requests to check if a render has completed or not.

### Usage Limits

The API plans currently have the following sage limits:

* max 10 requests per second
* max 2000 requests per month

If you need more requests please contact us.

### Environment Limits

The render environment has the following limits:

* Max 5 minutes render time – it's designed for short 30 sec to 2 min clips.
* The amount of footage you can ingest for each render is 500MB – i.e. the original footage you send to be trimmed and edited. That should be enough for 5-10 minutes of compressed HD mp4 footage.
